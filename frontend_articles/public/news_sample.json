This growth is attributed to strong demand from the biomedical and packaging sectors. Conversely, Asia-Pacific is poised to experience the highest CAGR of 18.4% from 2021 to 2030, propelled by the rapid growth of textile, electronics, and agriculture industries in the region to meet the needs of a burgeoning population.
